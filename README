This is a Flash ROM programmer for Terasic's DE2-115 board (for
the additional 8 MB Flash, *not* for the FPGA's configuration
memory). The programmer consists of two parts. The circuit on
the FPGA reads command bytes from a serial port. The commands
are low-level instructions, "bit-banging" the various input
lines of the Flash memory. The software running on the host
offers command-line options for device identification, erasing,
checking, reading, programming, and verifying the contents of
the Flash ROM. The program translates these high-level tasks
into command bytes, which are sent over the serial line to the
board, with the following communication parameters: 38400 Baud,
8N1, no flow control.
